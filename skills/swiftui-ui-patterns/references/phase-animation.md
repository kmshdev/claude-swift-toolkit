When a view is appearing with a transition, the transition will first be shown with the `willAppear` phase, then will be immediately moved to the `identity` phase. When a view is being removed, its transition is changed from the `identity` phase to the `didDisappear` phase. If a view is removed while it is still transitioning in, then its phase will change to `didDisappear`. If a view is re-added while it is transitioning out, its phase will change back to `identity`.

In the `identity` phase, transitions should generally not make any visual change to the view they are applied to, since the transition’s view modifications in the `identity` phase will be applied to the view as long as it is visible. In the `willAppear` and `didDisappear` phases, transitions should apply a change that will be animated to create the transition. If no animatable change is applied, then the transition will be a no-op.

The initial value that the keyframes will animate from.

A value to observe for changes.

A view builder closure that takes two parameters. The first parameter is a proxy value representing the modified view. The second parameter is the interpolated value generated by the keyframes.

Keyframes defining how the value changes over time. The current value of the animator is the single argument, which is equal to `initialValue` when the view first appears, then is equal to the end value of the previous keyframe animation on subsequent calls.

Note that the `content` closure will be updated on every frame while animating, so avoid performing any expensive operations directly within `content`.

If the trigger value changes while animating, the `keyframes` closure will be called with the current interpolated value, and the keyframes that you return define a new animation that replaces the old one. The previous velocity will be preserved, so cubic or spring keyframes will maintain continuity from the previous animation if they do not specify a custom initial velocity.

When a keyframe animation finishes, the animator will remain at the end value, which becomes the initial value for the next animation.

```swift
nonisolated func keyframeAnimator<Value>(initialValue: Value, trigger: some Equatable, @ViewBuilder content: @escaping @Sendable (PlaceholderContentView<Self>, Value) -> some View, @KeyframesBuilder<Value> keyframes: @escaping (Value) -> some Keyframes) -> some View

**Contents:**
- Overview

- Creating a phase animator

**Available on:** iOS 17.0+, iPadOS 17.0+, Mac Catalyst 17.0+, macOS 14.0+, tvOS 17.0+, visionOS 1.0+, watchOS 10.0+

Use one of the phase animator view modifiers like [phaseAnimator(*:content:animation:)](/documentation/swiftui/view/phaseanimator(*:content:animation:)) to create a phased animation in your app.
